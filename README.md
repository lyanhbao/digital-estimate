# **YouTube Video Data Fetcher and Cost Calculator**

## **Overview**

This application allows users to fetch video statistics from YouTube, compare old and new data for specific videos, and calculate advertising costs based on custom benchmarks and cost parameters. The app processes Excel files containing video data, calculates the differences in views and reactions, and then estimates the advertising costs based on the input benchmarks and costs provided by the user.

## **How It Works**

1. **Input API Key**: 
   The user provides their YouTube API key to allow the app to fetch video statistics.

2. **Upload Excel Files**:
   - Users upload an old Excel file and a new Excel file. These files should contain video URLs (links) and relevant statistics like "Number of Reactions, Comments & Shares" and "Views per Video".
   - The app will compare data from the old file with the new file to calculate the differences.

3. **Input Benchmarks and Costs**: 
   Users enter benchmark values and cost parameters for different platforms (Facebook, YouTube Bumper, YouTube Skippable View, etc.). These values are used to calculate the cost for each video based on the differences in views and reactions.

4. **Fetch Video Data**: 
   The app uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve the views and duration for the videos specified in the new Excel file.

5. **Calculate Advertising Costs**: 
   The app calculates the advertising cost based on the user's custom benchmarks and cost parameters for each video.

6. **Download Results**:
   Once the processing is complete, the user can download the updated Excel file containing the calculated costs along with the video data.
